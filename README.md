Development of Cloud Compute Images for Microbial Ecology

# Why cloud computing?
Cloud computing offers many advantages for processing metagenomics data:
1. No need to purchase and maintain expensive local compute infrastructure. This is especially important for small groups with limited budgets.
2. No scheduler. No queue. Saves costs and time while debugging pipelines and code.
3. Compute images for cloud community can be a community resource, saving time installing and updating software and databases.
4. Reproducibility. Others can replicate your compute environment exactly by re-using your image.
5. Infinite scalability enabling you to address bigger questions. 
6. Rapid access to NCBI data, but this only applies to Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.

# Status
1. (done) Create a custom arch linux image on gcloud. See wiki - [[Installing the Operating System]].
2. (done) Install programs and databases. See wiki - [[Scope and list of programs]], [[Installing all the Programs]], [[Installing all the Databases]].
3. (done) Share images with microbial ecology community. See wiki - [[Firing up your own Cloud Server]].
4. (in progress) Test and benchmark installed programs.
5. (in progress) Explore other cloud providers, such as AWS and UpCloud.
